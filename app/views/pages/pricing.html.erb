        <h3>How does the 7 day free trial work?</h3>
        <h4>The free trial gives you full access to all the content on BaseRails with full troubleshooting support. We want to make sure we're the right fit for what you're trying to learn. You can cancel your free trial at any time and you won't be charged. If you want to continue learning with BaseRails, we'll automatically start your paid subscription at the end of your 7 day trial.</h4>

        <h3>Do I need to have prior programming expereince?</h3>
        <h4>Not at all! We have students who have never written a line of code learn build robust apps with BaseRails. On the other hand, we also have students who come from computer science backgrounds and but don't know how to build websites. If you want to learn how to create functional web applications by working on projects, then we're the right fit for you. </h4>
        <h3>Can I change careers to become a web developer with BaseRails?</h3>
        <h4>That's really up to you! We think learning by doing projects is the best way to dive into web development. Not only will you learn how to code, you'll also have an undestanding of how a web application framework is built. You'll learn to think like a web developer and learn the latest technologies that Rails developers use. The rest is up to you!  </h4>

        <h3>What makes BaseRails different than other online resources?</h3>
        <h4>More than just teaching you to <i>code</i>, we teach you to <i>build</i>. We are the only learning platform that focuses exclusively on building fully functional web apps by doing projects. Other methods have a heavy focus on understanding syntax and grasping computer science theory. However, few people actually progress from this to building functional apps on their own. The end result is that millions of students start learning how to code, but few end up with something to show for their efforts. We make sure that students finish our course with a product they can either turn into a business or add to their portfolio.</h4>
        <h3>What projects will I be building?</h3>
        <h4>We teach you to build web applications in Ruby on Rails by building an online marketplace like Etsy. You'll be able to implement practical features like user accounts, online payments, and product listings. You can customize your app or apply your learnings to building other Rails apps.</h4>
        <h3>What programming languages do you guys teach?</h3>
        <h4>We mostly teach Ruby on Rails, which is based off of the Ruby programming language. However, we cover other popular web development technologies like Bootstrap, APIs, Javascript, SQlite, Github, and Heroku, among others.</h4>
